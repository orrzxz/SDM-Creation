# Project Overview

This project is designed to download, convert, and process Houdini documentation.

It involves converting PDF documentation to Markdown format and potentially chunking or further processing the resulting Markdown files.

Key directories include:
- `houdini_docs_pdf`: Original Houdini documentation in PDF format.
- `houdini_docs_mkdown`: Converted Houdini documentation in Markdown format.
- `Chunked_Markdown`: Processed or chunked Markdown files.
- `PDF_to_Markdown`: Contains the scripts for the conversion process.

The main scripts are located in the workspace root.
