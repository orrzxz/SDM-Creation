# Core Scripts

This project utilizes several key Python scripts located in the workspace root:

- [`app.py`](mdc:app.py): Likely the main entry point for the application, potentially orchestrating the conversion and chunking processes.
- [`pdf_to_markdown_converter.py`](mdc:pdf_to_markdown_converter.py): Contains the logic for converting PDF files found in `houdini_docs_pdf` to Markdown format, saving them in `houdini_docs_mkdown`.
- [`chunker.py`](mdc:chunker.py): Responsible for processing the Markdown files, likely breaking them down into smaller, manageable chunks stored in `Chunked_Markdown`.
